The objective of the game is to move the stack of disks from the leftmost stack to the rightmost stack.

The game follows three rules:
- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
- No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
