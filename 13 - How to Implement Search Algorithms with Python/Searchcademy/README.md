### Description of the project by [CODE]CADEMY PRO
In order to test a product, many companies use empty or “fake” data. Our company, Searchcademy, uses empty sparsely sorted data to test its awesome search engine. What exactly does that mean? Sparsely Sorted Data is data such that there is empty data in between the sorted values. For instance, an example dataset might look like:

```python
["Arthur", "", "", "", "", "Devan", "", "", "Elise", "", "", "", "Gary", "", "", "Mimi", "", "", "Parth", "", "", "", "Zachary"]
```

In this project, we will implement a modified version of iterative binary search to search through a sparsely sorted dataset.
