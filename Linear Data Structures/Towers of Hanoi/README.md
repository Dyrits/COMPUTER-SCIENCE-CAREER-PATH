> The objective of the game is to move the stack of disks from the leftmost stack to the rightmost stack.

> The game follows three rules:
>- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
>- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
>- No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

> In this project, we are going to use our knowledge of stacks to implement this game! Letâ€™s get started!
