### Description of the project by [CODE]CADEMY PRO
We’ve decided to pursue the dream of small-business ownership and open up a furniture store called *Lovely Loveseats for Neat Suites on Fleet Street*. With our newfound knowledge of Python programming, we’re going to build a system to help speed up the process of creating receipts for your customers.

In this project, we will be storing the names and prices of a furniture store’s catalog in variables. You will then process the total price and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal.

**Please note**: Projects do not run tests against your code. This experience is more open to your interpretation and gives you the freedom to explore. Remember that all variables must be declared *before* they are referenced in your code.
